Backflow can occur in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines.

One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>One common method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.
