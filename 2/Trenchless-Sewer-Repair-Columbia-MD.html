<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job since of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
