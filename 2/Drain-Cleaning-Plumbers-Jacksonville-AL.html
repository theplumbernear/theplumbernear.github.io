<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
