<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must meet or exceed the state requirements and bring the obligation for enforcing them.</p>

Then get the assistance you need immediately by calling the experts at Mr. Rooter Plumbing in Pittsburgh Our group of licensed plumbers are proud to offer reliable commercial and residential services including gas line installation, gas line replacement and gas line repair in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and neighboring cities.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
