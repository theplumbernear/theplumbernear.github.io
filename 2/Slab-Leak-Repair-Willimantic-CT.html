<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
