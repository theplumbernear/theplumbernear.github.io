The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
