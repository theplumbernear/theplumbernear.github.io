<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
