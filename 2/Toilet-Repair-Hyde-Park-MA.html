<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
