<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
