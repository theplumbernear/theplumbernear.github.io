<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
