<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you get in touch with a certified plumber if there is a persistent sewage odor in your home. Raw sewage is very unsafe and can posture major health dangers.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would usually trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater really quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
