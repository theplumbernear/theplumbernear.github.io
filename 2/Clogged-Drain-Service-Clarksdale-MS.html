Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
