<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Marseilles IL 61341</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
