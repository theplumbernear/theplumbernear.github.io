<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
