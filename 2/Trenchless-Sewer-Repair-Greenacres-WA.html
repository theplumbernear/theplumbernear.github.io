<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where hardness mineral ions are become a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regrowth.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Your EcoWater Pro will check your water to figure out the right water treatment for your house. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less space due to the fact that the softener's salt water tank nests within the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance solidity removal you can count on for years to come.</p>
