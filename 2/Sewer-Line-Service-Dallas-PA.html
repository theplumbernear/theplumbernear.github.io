<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, color, taste or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure might need replacing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
