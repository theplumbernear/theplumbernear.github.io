The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
