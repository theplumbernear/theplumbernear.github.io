<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are experts in sink repair and are all set to fix your clogged sink or carry out a sink installation to meet your needs.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
