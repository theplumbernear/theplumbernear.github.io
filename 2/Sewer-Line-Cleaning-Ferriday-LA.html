However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
