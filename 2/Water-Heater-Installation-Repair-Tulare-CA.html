The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continuously leak out very gradually. In time it can result in a considerable build of water. Leaked water typically remains under the house and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if your home's structure was not appropriately compacted. This is an unusual event and in general, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
