<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.
