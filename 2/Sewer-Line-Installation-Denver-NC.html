<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
