<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Long Beach CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
