<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
