<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

It most likely goes without saying that leaking pipes must be changed immediately. It might be typical to have condensation on warm water pipes, but it's absolutely not regular for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can cause a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and usage will ultimately wear them down. Though normal, it's still stressful to a homeowner, who might fear the trouble of employing a service professional to handle their (potentially) costly repairs rapidly and efficiently. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections ensure you understand every potential gas line issue, and our repairs make sure your system is working perfectly once again.</p>
