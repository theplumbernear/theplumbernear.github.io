<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Many sprinkling systems already have the appropriate backflow preventer installed and need only be evaluated yearly. Others may not fulfill state and local policies and may need to be replaced with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and situations that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District evaluates using each new renter. The correction needs to be made before water service is allowed if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
