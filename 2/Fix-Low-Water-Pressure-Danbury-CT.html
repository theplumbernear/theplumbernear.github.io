<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
