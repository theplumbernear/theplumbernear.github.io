<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Pinehurst NC</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually salt. Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about extremely low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
