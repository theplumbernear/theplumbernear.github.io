A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
