<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Danville KY 40422</h3>
<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
