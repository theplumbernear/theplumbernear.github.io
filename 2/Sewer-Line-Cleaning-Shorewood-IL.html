<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
