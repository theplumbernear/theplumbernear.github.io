Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
