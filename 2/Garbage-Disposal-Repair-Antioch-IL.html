<p>No, you ought to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about securing your drain and plumbing system.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
