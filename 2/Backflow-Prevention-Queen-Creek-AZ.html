<p>If you see nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the system, and twist ideal and left. If the motor spins freely, inspect that the breaker hasn't tripped and after that attempt the reset button. If these steps don't work, and your disposer's warranty has actually expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
