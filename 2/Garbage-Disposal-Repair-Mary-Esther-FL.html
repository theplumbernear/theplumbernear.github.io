<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
