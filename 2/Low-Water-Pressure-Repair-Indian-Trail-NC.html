<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
