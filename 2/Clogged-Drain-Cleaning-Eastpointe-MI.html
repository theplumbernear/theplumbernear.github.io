<p>Apollo Plumbing Service uses Portland and Vancouver thorough rooter services, including emergency clog eliminations or routine maintenance services. Our machines operate by snaking a rotating cable television with a connected blade through your pipes. The blades will remove the accumulation due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign objects.

<p>It is essential that all elements of your gas lines remain in good condition. The state of the pipe is important. As is the connection to your appliance and equipment.
