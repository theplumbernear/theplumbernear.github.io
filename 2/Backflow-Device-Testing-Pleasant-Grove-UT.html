<p>Due to the fact that they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are typically chosen. Other good choices are overload security, which switches off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically developed to be utilized with a septic system. offers an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
