Initially, plans for each device to be set up should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Declined plans must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
