<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
