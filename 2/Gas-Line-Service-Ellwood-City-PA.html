<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>A clogged or broken toilet can trigger serious disruptions to your house. At Magic Plumbing we work to ensure our house owners are never ever without this vital service. Whether you're experiencing an annoying clog or looking to replace an old toilet with something more contemporary. We have all your toilet needs covered in the San Francisco, CA area.</p>
