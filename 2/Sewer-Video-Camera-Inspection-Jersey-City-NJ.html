<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
