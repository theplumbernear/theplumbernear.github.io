<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. Energy Performance. Choosing a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is advisable. The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the higher the EF ranking. However, even if a water heater has a greater EF worth, it doesn't always indicate it will have lower operating costs.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
