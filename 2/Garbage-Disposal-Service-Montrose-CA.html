Prior to repiping can occur, nevertheless, you need to be able to identify the signs that this is even required. This can be challenging, considering that your plumbing system is mostly hidden from sight within crawlspaces or walls. Here's a quick guide of what you must look for.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
