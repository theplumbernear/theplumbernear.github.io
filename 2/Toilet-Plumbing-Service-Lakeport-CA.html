When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
