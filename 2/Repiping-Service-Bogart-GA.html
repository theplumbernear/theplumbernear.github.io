<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
