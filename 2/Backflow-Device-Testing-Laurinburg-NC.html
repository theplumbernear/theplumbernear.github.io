<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
