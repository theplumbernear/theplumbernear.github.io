Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>

New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham.
