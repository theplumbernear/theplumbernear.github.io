If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other two kinds of salts. Once the brand-new salt has actually had a chance to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting near to 10 years old, it's generally not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a new unit. It is advised that you have the garbage disposal replaced if problems end up being more frequent with an older system.

Place a container below the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
