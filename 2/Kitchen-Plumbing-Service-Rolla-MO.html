A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown.
