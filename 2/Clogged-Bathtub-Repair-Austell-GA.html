<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Austell Georgia</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Every hot water heater we install has been checked under the most severe water temperatures and was built to last a very long time.
