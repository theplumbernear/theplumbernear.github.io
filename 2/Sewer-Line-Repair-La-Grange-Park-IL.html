<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the problem may be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its ability to seal appropriately, creating waste and a greater water bill.</p>
