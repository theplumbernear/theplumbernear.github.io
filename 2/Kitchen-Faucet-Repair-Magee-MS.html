<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Magee MS</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
