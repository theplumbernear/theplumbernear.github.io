In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer.
