<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This rust can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Local - Tough water can trigger a lack of suds formation when soap is upset in water and cause the formation of lime scale in water heaters. Your water is red or brown. Some kinds of pipes can rust in time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your home is required due to the fact that not just are your pipes old, but your water quality is impacted too.</p>
