<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
