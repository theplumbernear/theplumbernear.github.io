<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
