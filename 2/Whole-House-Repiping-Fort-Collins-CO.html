<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Fort Collins CO</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
