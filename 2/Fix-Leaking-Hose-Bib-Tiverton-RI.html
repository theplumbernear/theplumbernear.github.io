<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
