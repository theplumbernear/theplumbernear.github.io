<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
