<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to offer decades of security. There are numerous local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all cause the assembly to weaken in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may seldom need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test information from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
