We can finish any needed water softener repairs. We can do that too if a full water softener replacement need to be essential. Your water quality truly is too crucial to take any chances with.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
