<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
