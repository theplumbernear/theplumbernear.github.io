<p>Whether you're a property owner, company owner, or property manager, eventually you will probably need to call a plumber. It's a good idea to do a little research into the world of plumbing before you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. An excellent plumber can save your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst problem in terms of issues that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
