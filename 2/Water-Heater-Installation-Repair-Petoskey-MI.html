<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally funnelled somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
