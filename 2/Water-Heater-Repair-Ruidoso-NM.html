<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
