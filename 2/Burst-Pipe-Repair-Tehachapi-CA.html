<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
