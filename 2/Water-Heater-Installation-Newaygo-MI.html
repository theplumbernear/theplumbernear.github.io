<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
