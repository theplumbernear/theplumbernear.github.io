<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
