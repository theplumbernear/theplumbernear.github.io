Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
