Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
