<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
