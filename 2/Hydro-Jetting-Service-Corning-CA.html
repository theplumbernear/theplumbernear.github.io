<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and big are not interested in backflow prevention concerns. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome indicate that the level of security on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>

The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
