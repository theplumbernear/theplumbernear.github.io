<p>Often, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll observe the same problems cropping up once again and once again, even though you've had them fixed.

<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
