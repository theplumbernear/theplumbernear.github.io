<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Ensure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
