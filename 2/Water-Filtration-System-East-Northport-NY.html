<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
