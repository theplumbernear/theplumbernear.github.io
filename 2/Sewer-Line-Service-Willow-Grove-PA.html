This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
