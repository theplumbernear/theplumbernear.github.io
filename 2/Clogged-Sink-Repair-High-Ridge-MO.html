Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and big are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser level their property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to attain that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome suggest that the level of protection on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>
