The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
