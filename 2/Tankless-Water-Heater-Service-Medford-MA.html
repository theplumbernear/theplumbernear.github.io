<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a water system is labelled "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in truth, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing taste many individuals find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>

It's called Hybrid Water Heating. A Hybrid Water Heater presses cold water from the bottom up through a series of radiating transfer pipes. It's takes full advantage of energy effectively by pressing the heat in separate directions, and reuses the energy created multiple times.
