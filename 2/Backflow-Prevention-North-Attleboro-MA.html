<p>Supply of water by the water company consists of some quantities of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems get rid of these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenses. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>One common method for a house's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
