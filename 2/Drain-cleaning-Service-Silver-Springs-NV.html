As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there ought to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you ought to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils.
