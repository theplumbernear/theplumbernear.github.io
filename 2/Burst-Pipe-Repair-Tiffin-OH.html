<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
