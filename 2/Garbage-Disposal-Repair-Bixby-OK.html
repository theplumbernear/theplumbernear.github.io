<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
