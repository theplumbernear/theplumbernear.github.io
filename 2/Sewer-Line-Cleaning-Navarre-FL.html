Cooking Grease: Cooking grease must never ever be thrown down the kitchen drain. While it may decrease as a liquid, as it cools it can become strong, finish your pipes while doing so. It still remains sticky, however, which enables it to bring in other particles, eventually creating an enormous clog in your pipes.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement typically will not require added fees, such as application costs. New meters must fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers may need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options.
