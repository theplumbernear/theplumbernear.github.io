For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
