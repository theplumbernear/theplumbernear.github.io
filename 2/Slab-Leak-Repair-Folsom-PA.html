It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
