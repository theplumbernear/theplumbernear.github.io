<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to pour in over the counter drain-clearing items, lots of plumbers recommend against it. Not just are the chemicals harmful if exposed to human skin, they may also damage drain pipes if overused. There are additional problems that might show up, which is why our experienced plumbers will perform a thorough inspection of your unit to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed choice on whether your issue can be fixed by a basic repair or if changing the garbage disposal is eventually the much better choice.</p>
