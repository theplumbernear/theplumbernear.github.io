Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
