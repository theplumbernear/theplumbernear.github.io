<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Herkimer NY</h3>
<p>We are proficient at what we do and we care about our clients! Your perspective is quite thought about in every job kcb Plumbing contractors performs. Backflow is the reversal of the circulation of water in the plumbing system. It can take place when the pressure in the water pipe or a home's plumbing system changes. If your toilet is overruning, then you have a clog in the drain line someplace. The first step would be to clear the clog which you may need a professional plumber for.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
