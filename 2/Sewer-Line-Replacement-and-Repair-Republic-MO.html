<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth learning about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
