<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
