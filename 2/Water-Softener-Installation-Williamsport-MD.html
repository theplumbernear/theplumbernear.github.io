<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow brought on by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing. While many plumbers expect payment on the day of service, or in a timely manner once they have sent out an invoice, lots of plumbing contractors require that you pay a deposit upfront. A deposit of no greater than half of the job price quote is typically gathered ahead of time and deducted from the overall project cost when it is completed.</p>
