<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
