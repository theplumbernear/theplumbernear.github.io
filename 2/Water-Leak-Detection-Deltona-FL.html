During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Consider all the locations water flows in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional evaluation must cover.
