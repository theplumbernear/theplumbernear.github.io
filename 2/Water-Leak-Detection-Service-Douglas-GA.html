<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Douglas GA</h3>
<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
