<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Vancleave MS</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Breathing in leaked gas in an indoor space, such as your house can lead to a lack of oxygen in the air and result in hypoxia.
