While there are a lot of variables that might enter play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The waste disposal unit is clogged or gradually draining pipes. While a waste disposal unit is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a waste disposal unit, causing obstructions.

<p>There's a great opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be fixed by replacing that area of damaged piping.
