<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary clogs even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of contaminants and will need to be changed. (This should not hold true if the resin is occasionally regenerated and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Unanticipated modifications in water pressure could potentially be due to corrosion and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll probably notification lower water pressure in the shower or when washing meals. The very best solution is to replace your plumbing with brand-new pipes that do not have accumulation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
