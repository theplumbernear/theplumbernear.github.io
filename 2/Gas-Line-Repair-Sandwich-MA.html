<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Sandwich MA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system may not just save consumers money but might also be environmentally friendly, due to the fact that it helps cut back on hazardous cleaning agents going into water streams. In locations where there is very tough water, consumers can often cut detergent usage in dishwashing machines and washing machines by more than 50% after softening and get the very same outcomes.</p>
