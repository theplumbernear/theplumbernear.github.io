<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.
