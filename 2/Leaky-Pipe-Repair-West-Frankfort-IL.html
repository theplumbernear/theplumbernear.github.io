<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
