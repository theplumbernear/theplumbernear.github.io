<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
