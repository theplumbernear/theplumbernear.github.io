<p>Most water heaters are constructed to last for 8-12 years and are a major energy consumer in your home. If your hot water heater goes beyond that age variety, you need to consider replacing it with a newer, more energy effective model.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
