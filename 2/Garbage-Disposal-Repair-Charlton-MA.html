It is rarely used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.
