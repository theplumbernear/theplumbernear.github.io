<p>You most likely understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, tubs, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working effectively that's really all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

You, therefore, need to utilize more and more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
