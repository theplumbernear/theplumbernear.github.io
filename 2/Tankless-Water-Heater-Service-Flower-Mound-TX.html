<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater very rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for years and have very little problems that can be quickly repaired without replacement. Nevertheless, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is very important to have a licensed and knowledgeable plumber manage the task. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than 30 years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a brand-new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a new home, or just wishing to upgrade your existing toilet, we guarantee that our installation process will not harm your home or its plumbing system.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule an estimate as soon as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
