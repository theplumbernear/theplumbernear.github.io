Check for leakages under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as essential. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as wanted.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house.
