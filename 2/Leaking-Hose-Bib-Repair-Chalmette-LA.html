<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is a development that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism frequently recognized for structured growth in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of temporary firmness in water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
