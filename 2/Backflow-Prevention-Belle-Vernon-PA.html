<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.
