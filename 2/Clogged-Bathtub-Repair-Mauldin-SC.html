<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Unanticipated changes in water pressure could possibly be because of deterioration and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll probably notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing meals. The best service is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that don't have buildup.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Sometimes drain repair needs can be fixed relatively rapidly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be disassembled, examined, and cleared prior to being replaced. In some cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is needed (like a pvc, tailpiece, or reducer  trap) to ensure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to discuss repair choices.</p>
