Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
