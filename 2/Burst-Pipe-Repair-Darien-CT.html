This includes the cost for a plumber or handyman to shut off the water, disconnect the drain, cap the lines, detach the faucets and fittings, remove the sink from the base cabinet, and pile the debris onsite. Lots of prospective home purchasers are asking for drain inspections before they purchase a home. TLC's drain specialists are qualified and experienced in performing drain and sewer line inspections for homes. We supply video inspections so sellers and buyers can get a comprehensive analysis of the drain system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out yearly forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
