<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
