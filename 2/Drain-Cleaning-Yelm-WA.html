<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with waste disposal unit installation make the job potentially harmful. That makes it a great reason to hire a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal.

<p>A waste disposal unit lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This average life expectancy estimation assumes regular wear and tear of the unit. The life-span of a waste disposal unit might be lower in the case of neglect, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation?

<p>If you have actually ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your meals that will not go away, white shirts that turn dull and gray after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can remove these problems and more. Difficult water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to fret about any issues with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks much easier and less frustrating for everyone involved.</p>
