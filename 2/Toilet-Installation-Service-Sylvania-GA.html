<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring frequently, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
