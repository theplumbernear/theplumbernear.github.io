<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
