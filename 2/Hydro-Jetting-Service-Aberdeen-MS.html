You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, odor, taste or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure may need replacing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
