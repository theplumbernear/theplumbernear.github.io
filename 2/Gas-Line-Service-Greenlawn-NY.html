<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
