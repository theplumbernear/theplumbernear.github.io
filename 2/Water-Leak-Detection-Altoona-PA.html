<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
