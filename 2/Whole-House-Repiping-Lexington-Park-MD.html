<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you must wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
