<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
