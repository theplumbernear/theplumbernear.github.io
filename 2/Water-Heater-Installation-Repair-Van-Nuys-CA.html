<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Van Nuys CA 91406</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
