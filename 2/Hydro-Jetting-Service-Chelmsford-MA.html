<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
