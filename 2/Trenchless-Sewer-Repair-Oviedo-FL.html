<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
