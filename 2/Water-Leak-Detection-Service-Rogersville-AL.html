<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a durable and exceptional alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to harden in place for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be inspected one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
