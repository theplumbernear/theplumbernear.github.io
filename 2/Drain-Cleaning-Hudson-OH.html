Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange happen?

<p>With time, like any other device in your home, your garbage disposal. may require repairs. A disposal system may begin or clog to leak through heavy, or incorrect, use.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
