<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task since of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
