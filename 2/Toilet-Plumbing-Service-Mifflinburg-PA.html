<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough task because of the age of your house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
