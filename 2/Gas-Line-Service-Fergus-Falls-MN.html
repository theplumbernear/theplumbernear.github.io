<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Fergus Falls MN</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
