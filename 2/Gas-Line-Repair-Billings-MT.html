<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>I believe I got ripped off. I called thinking it could perhaps be fixed, however they said it would need to be replaced. This was the cost for the new disposal and installation, even with my instructor's discount. When you need water heater repair or installation, call Premier Plumbing in Chesapeake Virginia.

<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
