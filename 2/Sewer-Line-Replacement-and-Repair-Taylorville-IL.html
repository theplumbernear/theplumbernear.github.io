<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
