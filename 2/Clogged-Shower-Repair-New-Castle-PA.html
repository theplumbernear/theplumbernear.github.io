Copper is basic due to the fact that it's lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is hard to install, which implies greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which suggests plumbers can flex the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves money and time and lowers the threat of joint leaks.
