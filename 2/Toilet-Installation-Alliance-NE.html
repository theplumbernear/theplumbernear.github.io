<p>Your costs also will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and connecting the new one. The majority of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that appear will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might affect the time it takes. Since carbon monoxide gets released into the air while burning natural gas, these types of heaters can result in a substantial amount of contamination.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly needed, sometimes the plumber might have to repair or upgrade electrical wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This usually costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be blemished or degraded. Contact our experts to figure out the level of the problem.</p>
