<p>Toilet repair tends to freak most people out a little, which is totally reasonable. No one wants to unintentionally break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. Nevertheless, most of toilet repairs are uncomplicated and basic tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems particularly use a component that warms up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continually heated as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is instantly switched off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature is usually pre-set to fit your needs and choices. Tankless electric water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters because they only heat water when needed.</p>
