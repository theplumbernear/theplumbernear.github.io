<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.
