<p>Like any household device, water heaters require routine maintenance to operate securely and effectively. Regular water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and help avoid unanticipated leakages or other problems.

Seek advice from your local Roto-Rooter plumber to develop a water heater maintenance schedule that will take full advantage of the life of your home appliance.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major offenders. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink.

Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for typical home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
