<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
