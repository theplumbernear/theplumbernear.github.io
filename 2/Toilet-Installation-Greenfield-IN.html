<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
