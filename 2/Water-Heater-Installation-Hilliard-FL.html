Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
