Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line.
