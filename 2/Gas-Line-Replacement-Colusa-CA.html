If you're transforming your home to natural gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).

This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
