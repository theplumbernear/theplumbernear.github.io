<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
