<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
