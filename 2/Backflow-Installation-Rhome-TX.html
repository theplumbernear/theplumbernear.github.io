<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Professionals Because 1938. When again, you can use your wrench to tighten the lock bolt, however moving it in a clockwise instructions. Take it out entirely and clean it completely if the trap continues to leak. If you presume a clog, you can choose to clear the drain with the help of an auger. If your sink is blocked, water will drain really gradually; taking from a minute or more, to even 10.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation.
