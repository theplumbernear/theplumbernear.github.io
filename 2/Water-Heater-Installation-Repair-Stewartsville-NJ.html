<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
