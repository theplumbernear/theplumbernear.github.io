<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
