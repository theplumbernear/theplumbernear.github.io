<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
