<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
