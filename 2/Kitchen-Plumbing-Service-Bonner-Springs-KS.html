<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak.
