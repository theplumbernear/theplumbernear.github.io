<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is essential that you call a qualified plumber if there is a relentless sewage smell in your home. Raw sewage is really dangerous and can present major health threats.</p>
<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any offered source to achieve their objective, however fire department automobiles often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
