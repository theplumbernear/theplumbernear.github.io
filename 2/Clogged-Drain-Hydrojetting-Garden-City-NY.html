<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Garden City NY</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
