<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical option, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
