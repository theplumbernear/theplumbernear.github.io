They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
