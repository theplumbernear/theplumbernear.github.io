<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building of a new or remodelled building is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a component can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
