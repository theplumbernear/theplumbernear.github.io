<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
