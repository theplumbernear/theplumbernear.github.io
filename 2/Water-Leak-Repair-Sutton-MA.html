The pink movie is actually a safe bacteria that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. Once the brand-new salt has had a possibility to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
