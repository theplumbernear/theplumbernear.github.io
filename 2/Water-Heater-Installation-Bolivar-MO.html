<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and obstructions - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain too. After completing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
