<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
