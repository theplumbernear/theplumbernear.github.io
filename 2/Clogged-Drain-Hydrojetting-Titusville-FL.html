<p>Inspect the home's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and readily available for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
