<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Some softeners work on electricity, however some more recent water softeners use waterpower. Costs of a water softener considerably depend upon the type of water softener and the kind of energy that is used, but also upon the hardness of the water that needs softening and the water use. When the water is very tough and it is utilized heavily, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
