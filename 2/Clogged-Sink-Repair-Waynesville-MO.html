<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved. Ensuring the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
