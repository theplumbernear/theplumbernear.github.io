You might be thinking that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be right.

<p>There are a number of courses of action you can take if you're tired of purchasing bottled water and do not desire to deal with nasty tasting tap water. The easiest is to buy a filtered water pitcher from brand names such as Brita.

Merely fill the pitcher with tap water and enable it to work through the filter. Then, it's all set to drink and enjoy. You can also opt to install a water filter on your sink faucet. This will filter the water and improve its taste, while also decreasing smell. Faucet filtration systems are inexpensive and easy to install, with many designs boasting one click" installation.</p>
