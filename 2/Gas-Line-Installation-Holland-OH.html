The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>We specialize in repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electrical hot water heater and tankless water heaters.
