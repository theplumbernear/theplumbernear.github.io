<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Reedsburg WI</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
