If there is a persistent sewage odor in your house, it is essential that you call a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely unsafe and can position serious health threats.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
