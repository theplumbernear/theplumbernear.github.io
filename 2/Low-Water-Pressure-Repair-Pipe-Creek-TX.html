<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
