<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Tallapoosa GA</h3>
<p>Contrary to what lots of think, having a waste disposal unit actually safeguards your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food cleaned down a drain unintentionally or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering obstructions and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a garbage disposal wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
