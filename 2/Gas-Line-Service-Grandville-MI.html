<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
