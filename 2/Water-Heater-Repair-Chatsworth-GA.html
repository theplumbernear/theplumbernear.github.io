<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur in time from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger gradually, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can combat hard water in various methods, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
