<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
