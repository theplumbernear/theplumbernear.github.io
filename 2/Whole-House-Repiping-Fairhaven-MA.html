<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
