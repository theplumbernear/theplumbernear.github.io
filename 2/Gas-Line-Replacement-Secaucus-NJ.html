<h3>Blocked Sewer in Secaucus NJ 07094 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that originate inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will identify the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
