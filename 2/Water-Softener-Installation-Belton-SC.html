They typically utilize sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to dissolve gunky build-up. While reliable at removing obstructions, they might do your plumbing more harm than great. Here are three factors to prevent pouring these extreme chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
