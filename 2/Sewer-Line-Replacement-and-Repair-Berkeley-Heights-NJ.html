<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Berkeley Heights NJ 07922</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
