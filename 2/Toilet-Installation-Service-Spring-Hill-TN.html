<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided outstanding service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts. Not just was he extensive and incredibly professional but he was able to respond to all my concerns worrying the service. If I could, I would give 6 stars. A camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most reliable methods of locating the precise whereabouts of a plumbing problem. A plumber will place a specially developed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to determine where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
