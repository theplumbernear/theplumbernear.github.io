It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and complete simple repairs, so consider that with the cost when attempting to deal with the problem by yourself. The reason a toilet will not flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can likewise be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can diagnose the issue and repair it.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, most drain concerns can only be found once they begin to back up. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be carried out.
