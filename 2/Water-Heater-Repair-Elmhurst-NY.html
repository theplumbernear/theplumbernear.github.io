<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads.

<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
