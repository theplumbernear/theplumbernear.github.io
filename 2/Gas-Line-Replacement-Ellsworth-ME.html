<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Ellsworth ME</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer choice includes hose connection vacuum breakers, atmospheric vacuum breakers, double check valves and vented double check valves. Each backflow preventer is evaluated for performance and efficiency before leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory.
