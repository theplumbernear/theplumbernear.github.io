<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
