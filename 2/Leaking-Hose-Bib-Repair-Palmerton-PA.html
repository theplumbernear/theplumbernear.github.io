<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
