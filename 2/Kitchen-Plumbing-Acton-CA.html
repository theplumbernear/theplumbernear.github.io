<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.

<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Acton CA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
