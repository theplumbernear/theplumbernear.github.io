<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
