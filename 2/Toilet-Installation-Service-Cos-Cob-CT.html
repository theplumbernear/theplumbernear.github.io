<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Cos Cob CT</h3>
<p>The toilet is leaking. You have a leak if you hear your toilet running consistently or discover water pooling around the base. While repairs can fix a leak, it's typically much better to buy a brand-new toilet. A leak can go unnoticed, triggering damage to your subfloor.

<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly kept. Making certain the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
