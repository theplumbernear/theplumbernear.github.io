<p>Frequently, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll observe the same problems cropping up once again and again, although you've had them repaired. Often, these problems have their roots in your drain and pipe systems, but they've been ignored, and quicker, less expensive repairs have been carried out in place of drain cleanings. The specialist plumbers at Royal Class Service are here to clean your drains and take care of your home.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
