<p>Property owners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical system is more cost-effective. The answer depends on your home.

Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>

Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific info is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>
