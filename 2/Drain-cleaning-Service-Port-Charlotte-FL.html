<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
