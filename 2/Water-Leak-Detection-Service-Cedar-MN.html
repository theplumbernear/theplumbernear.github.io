<p>There are a number of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever.

Most fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
