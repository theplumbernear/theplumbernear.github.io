<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
