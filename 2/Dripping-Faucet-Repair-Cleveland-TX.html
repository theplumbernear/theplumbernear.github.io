<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
