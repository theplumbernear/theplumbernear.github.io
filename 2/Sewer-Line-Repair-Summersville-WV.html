<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
