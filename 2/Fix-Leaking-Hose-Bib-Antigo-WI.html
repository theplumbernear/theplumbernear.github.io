<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions guarantee the security, security and constant efficiency of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and rust within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the inside of the product and the pipe streaming through it. This repair technique is more suitable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
