If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
