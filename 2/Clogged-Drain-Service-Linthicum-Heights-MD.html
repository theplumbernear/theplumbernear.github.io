I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
