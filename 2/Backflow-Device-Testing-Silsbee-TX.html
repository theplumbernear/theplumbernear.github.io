The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
