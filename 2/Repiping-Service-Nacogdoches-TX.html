<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public supply of water and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of protection for the public supply of water system.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
