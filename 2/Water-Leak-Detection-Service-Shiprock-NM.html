Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
