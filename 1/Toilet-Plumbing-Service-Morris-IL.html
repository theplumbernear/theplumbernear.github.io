<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case.
