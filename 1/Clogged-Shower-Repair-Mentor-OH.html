Sickness can result from consuming water that has actually been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>If you see nothing apparent, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist right and left. Examine that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins easily.
