<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
