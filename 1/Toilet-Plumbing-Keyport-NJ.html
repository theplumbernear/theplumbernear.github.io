<p>The excellent news is that it does not necessarily need a repair of your whole system if you presume your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
