<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, however if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. If your toilet is reasonably brand-new, you might need to switch bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain.

Examine the list of state licensing firms to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Before salt starts working in a water softener it needs a little home time within the tank, given that the salt is dissolving slowly.

It's time for a new one if your toilet obstructs more than when per week.</p>
