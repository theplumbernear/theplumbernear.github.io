<h3>Hot Water Heater Problems in Marion Arkansas</h2>
<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
