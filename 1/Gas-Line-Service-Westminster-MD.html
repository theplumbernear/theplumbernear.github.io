Look for leaks and tighten up as needed. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as wanted.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
