<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Hopewell VA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite cheap and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. Ultimately triggering a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow. This included with other particles in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
