These blockages can transform into greater plumbing concerns if you're not careful.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
