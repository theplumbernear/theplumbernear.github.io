<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is a development that simulates biomineralization, the mechanism typically recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely eliminate momentary firmness in water.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular pollutants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be fixed with the best RO system.</p>
