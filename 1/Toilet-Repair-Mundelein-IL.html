<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
