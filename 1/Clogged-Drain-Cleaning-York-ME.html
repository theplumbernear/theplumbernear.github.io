<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber York ME</h3>
<p>The most effective method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working appropriately. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
