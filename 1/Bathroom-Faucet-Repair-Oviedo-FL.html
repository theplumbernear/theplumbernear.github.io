<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Oviedo FL 32765</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
