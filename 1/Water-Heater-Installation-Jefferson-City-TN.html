From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse effects and are, in fact, important daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating flavor many people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents.
