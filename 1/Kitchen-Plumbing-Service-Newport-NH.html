<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
