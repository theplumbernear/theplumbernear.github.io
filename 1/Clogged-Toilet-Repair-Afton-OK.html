<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Afton</h2>

<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the option is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to solve the problem. Other times a more extensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
