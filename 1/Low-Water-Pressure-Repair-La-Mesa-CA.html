<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.
