Nevertheless, the majority of toilet repairs are uncomplicated and easy jobs - such as changing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most common concern we encounter regarding toilet repair is how to find the ideal parts for your toilet. In some cases this is simple, and sometimes it's not. Primarily it's easy though.</p>
<p>For nonemergency jobs-- a remodel or restorative deal with your plumbing-- you need a pro who comprehends residential-system design and knows the code in your area. He also needs to have the ability to operate in a completed environment. That suggests putting down a piece of scrap carpets to safeguard floorings and cutting exact, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, only when necessary.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be disassembled, examined, and cleared before being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman might identify that a replacement part is required (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to guarantee normal operation for your drain.
