<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes.

<p>Inspecting the condition, water, and age lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leakages. If the water heater has been preserved with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic guarantee.
