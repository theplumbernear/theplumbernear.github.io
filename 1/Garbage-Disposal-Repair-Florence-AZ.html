<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
