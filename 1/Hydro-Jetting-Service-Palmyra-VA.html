<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, including poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and rust.

In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Other than for domestic pump and pump and watering systems, certification is not needed to install plumbing systems outside of a structure (e.g., water lines linked directly to municipal water mains, sewer line connections, and so on).
