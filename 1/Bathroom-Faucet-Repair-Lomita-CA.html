<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
