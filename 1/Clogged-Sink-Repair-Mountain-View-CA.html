<h3>Bathroom Plumbing in Mountain View California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
