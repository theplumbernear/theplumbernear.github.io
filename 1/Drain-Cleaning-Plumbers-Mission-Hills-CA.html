<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you should only hire a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
