<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Gautier MS</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed prior to the 1970s and has not undergone improvement or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually corroded and decayed over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger significant leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
