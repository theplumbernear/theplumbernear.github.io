<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first acquire the needed authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for additional information on obtaining an authorization. Once you obtain a license you can commence with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
