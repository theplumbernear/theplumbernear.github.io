<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>If it gradually drains away as you work, include more hot water. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a brand-new technique. Tankless systems link directly to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is required. This leads to cost savings on your energy expense.
