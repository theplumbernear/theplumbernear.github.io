Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
