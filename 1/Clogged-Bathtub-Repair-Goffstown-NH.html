<p>Toilet repair tends to freak the majority of people out a little, which is completely understandable. Nobody wishes to unintentionally break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, most of toilet repairs are uncomplicated and easy jobs - such as changing a worn flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
