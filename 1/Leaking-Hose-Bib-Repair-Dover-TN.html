<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Dover</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

When you include a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
