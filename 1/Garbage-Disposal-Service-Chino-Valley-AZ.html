<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any readily available source to attain their goal, however fire department lorries often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
