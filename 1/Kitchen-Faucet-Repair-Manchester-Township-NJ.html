Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is extremely important. Nevertheless, you have to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight equally and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
