Camera work in locating buried septic systems or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to determine proper maintenance schedules or the level of necessary repairs.

<p>When a gas line is burst, it immediately ends up being a severe safety threat. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it could cause a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being fired up. The first top priority is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company if a person recognizes that they have burst a gas line.</p>
