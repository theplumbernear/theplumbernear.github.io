<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
