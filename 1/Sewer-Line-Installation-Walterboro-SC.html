<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is another essential aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>

While this might operate in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your house, meaning that problem could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system.

<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Walterboro SC</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
