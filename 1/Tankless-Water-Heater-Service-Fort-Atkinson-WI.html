<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
