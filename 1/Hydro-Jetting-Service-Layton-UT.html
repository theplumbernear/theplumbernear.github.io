<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is in fact a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other two kinds of salts. As soon as the brand-new salt has actually had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
