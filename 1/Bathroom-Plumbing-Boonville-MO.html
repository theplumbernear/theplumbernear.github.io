<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly.
