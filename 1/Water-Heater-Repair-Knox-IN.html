<p>One typical way for a house's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread exponentially if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
