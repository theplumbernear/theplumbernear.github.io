<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
