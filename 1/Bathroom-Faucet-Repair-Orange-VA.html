<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
