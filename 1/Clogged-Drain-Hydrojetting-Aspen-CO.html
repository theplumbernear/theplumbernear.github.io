<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
