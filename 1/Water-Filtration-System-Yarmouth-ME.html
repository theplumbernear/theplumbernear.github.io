Illness can result from consuming water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>For nonemergency tasks-- a remodel or restorative deal with your plumbing-- you need a pro who comprehends residential-system design and knows the code in your area.

Holding on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
