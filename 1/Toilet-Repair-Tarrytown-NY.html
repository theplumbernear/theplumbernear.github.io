Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a resilient and excellent alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline.
