<p>If a gas water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-effective, homeowners frequently ask. The response depends upon your house.

When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
