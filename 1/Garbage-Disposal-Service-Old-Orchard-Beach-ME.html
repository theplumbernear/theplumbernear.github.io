<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very rare cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
