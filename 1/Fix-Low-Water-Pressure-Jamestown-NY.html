<p>Having your plumbing routinely examined is an essential component of preventative maintenance. However, lots of homeowners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not examine their pipes up until there is a pressing issue. Regrettably, this technique permits leaks, tears, and other problems to go undetected, enabling them to become worse and even worse as time goes on.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
