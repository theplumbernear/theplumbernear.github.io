<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.
