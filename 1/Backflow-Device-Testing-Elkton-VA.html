<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
