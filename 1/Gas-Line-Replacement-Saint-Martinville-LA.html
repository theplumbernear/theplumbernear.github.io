<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
