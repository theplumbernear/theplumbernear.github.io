Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
