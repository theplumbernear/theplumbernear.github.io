It is very important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. When the brand-new salt has had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
