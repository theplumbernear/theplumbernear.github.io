<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.
