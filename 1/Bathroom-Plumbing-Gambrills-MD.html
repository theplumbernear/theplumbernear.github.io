<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common enough that lots of people choose diy repairs. However sometimes even determining the leak can be an issue. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
