<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the savings have actually been based mainly on minimizing chemical and detergent expenses. While those savings are still significant, brand-new commercial softening innovation utilizing multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides considerable water and salt savings.</p>

Moreover, thanks to its unique, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water use patterns, changing its soft water delivery based on your requirements. In this way, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an unlimited supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
