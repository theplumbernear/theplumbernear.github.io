<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
