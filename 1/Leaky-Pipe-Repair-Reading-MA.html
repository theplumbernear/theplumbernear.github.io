The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

Lots of sprinkling systems currently have the correct backflow preventer set up and need just be checked each year. Others may not fulfill state and local regulations and may need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
