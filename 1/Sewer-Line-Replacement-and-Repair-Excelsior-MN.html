Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
