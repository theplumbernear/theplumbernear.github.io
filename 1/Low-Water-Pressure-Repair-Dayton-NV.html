<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.
