<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or business, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically but you can generally flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little clogs can become big ones relatively rapidly.</p>
