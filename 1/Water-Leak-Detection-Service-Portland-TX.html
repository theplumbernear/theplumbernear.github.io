<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the lawn above it to end up being soaked.

<p>Galvanized steel drinkable supply of water and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly pricey, and tough to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building regulations non-combustibility requirements generally found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.
