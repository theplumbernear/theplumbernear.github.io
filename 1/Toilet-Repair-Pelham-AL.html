<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
