<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

This repair technique is normally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>
