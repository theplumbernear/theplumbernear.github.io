<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
