<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
