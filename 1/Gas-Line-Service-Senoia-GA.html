<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Using the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
