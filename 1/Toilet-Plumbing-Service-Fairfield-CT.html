Water pressure may be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
