You may smell the revolting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that portion of your lawn. The scenario is fraught with problems due to the fact that the swampiness will bring in undesirable creatures. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
