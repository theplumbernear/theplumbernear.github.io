<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, regardless of their significance. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the watering line within your business, where irrigation meets the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>
