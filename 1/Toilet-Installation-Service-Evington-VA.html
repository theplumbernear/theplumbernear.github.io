<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
