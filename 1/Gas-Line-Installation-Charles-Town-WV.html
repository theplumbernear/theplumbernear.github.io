<p>Hydro-jetting is a method of getting rid of build up and particles in tanks and lines by utilizing extremely high-pressure water to get rid of blockages. These blockages could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have built up with time. Hydro jetting's advanced technology enables the process to be quick and efficient.

<p>If your house uses around 45 gallons of warm water every day, the on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water. They can also minimize the energy required for houses with far higher needs also.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
