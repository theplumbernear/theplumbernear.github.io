<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their unclean or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are simple to utilize and low-cost, but they harm your pipes and their effects are just short term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
