<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
