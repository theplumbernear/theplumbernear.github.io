<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger rust that obstructs the line.

This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

Small clogs can develop into huge ones fairly quickly.</p>
