<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
