<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
