<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Old Hickory TN</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
