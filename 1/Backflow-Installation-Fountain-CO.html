<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
