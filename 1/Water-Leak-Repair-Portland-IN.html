<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Portland IN</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
