<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the main and very first questions that you must ask yourself. The age of your house is a crucial element to understand whether you need to repipe your home.

If your house was built decades before that, possibilities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimum rates.</p>
