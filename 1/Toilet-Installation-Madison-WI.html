<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are interesting in securing people's lives and to a lesser extent their home. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source available to accomplish that objective. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as a result imply that the level of protection on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>
