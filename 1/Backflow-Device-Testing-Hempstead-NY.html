<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
