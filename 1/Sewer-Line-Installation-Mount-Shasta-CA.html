<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Mount Shasta CA</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as necessary. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as preferred.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a house is since there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty inexpensive and easy to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, eventually causing a backup. This added with other debris in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
