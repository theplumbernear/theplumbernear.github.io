<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions ensure the security, security and consistent performance of research, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. Checking the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be major issue. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house should have water.
