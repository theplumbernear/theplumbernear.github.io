<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in fact, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing flavor many individuals find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be tough.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
