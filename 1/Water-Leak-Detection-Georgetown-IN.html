Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
