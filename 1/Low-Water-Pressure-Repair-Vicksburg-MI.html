<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
