<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
