<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
