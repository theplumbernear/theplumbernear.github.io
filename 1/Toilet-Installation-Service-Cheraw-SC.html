<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
