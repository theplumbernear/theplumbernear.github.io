<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items containing severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
