<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is just equipped to deal with softer organic waste. It might cause it to jam and not work properly if bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you might need to switch toilet tissue or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
