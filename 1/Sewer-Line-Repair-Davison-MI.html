<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
