<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water pipe are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
