<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the public supply of water system.</p>
