<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Brooklyn MI</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
