<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

The pink film is in fact a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 kinds of salts. As soon as the new salt has had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
