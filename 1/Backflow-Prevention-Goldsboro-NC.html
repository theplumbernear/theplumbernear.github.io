<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
