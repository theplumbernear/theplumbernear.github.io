<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines.

Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

This ensures that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems remains detached from clean" water.</p>
