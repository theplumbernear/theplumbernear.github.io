<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for decades, so we're generally employed for kitchen and bath remodels.

Components and sinks may also establish drain problems that require a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also include adjusting or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
