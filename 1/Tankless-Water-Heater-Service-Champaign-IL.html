<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. When the brand-new salt has had an opportunity to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
