Water will leak into the cabinet below if the leak is far enough down the water line.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
