Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a great concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been particularly created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and might eventually cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
