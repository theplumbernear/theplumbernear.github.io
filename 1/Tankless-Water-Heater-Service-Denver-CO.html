Drip legs catch moisture so that it doesn't enter the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>
