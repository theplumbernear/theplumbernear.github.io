This means polyethylene piping. This plastic material is relatively resilient and versatile and can endure fundamental temperature level variations. PEX is resistant to scaling, rust, and chlorine and the pipes can be pieced together without elbows or joints.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces.
