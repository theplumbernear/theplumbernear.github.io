<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

A professional site inspection is crucial to a successful repipe. As soon as the plumbing system is inspected and okayed, its time to tidy up the mess.
