<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
