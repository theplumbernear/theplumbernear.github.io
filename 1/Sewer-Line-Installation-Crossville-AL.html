<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Municipal - Hard water can cause a lack of suds formation when soap is agitated in water and trigger the formation of lime scale in water heaters. Your water is red or brown. Some kinds of pipes can rust with time. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a brown or reddish color. In this case, repiping your house is necessary due to the fact that not only are your pipes old, however your water quality is impacted also.</p>
