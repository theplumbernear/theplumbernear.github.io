<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer decades of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger defense assembly.</p>
