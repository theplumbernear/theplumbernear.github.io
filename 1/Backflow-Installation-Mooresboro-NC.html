<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Mooresboro NC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
