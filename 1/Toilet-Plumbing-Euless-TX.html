<p>If you have a septic system, then you may mistakenly believe that you can not have a waste disposal unit, and this is not true. Nevertheless, house owners with waste disposal unit and septic tanks might need to pump their septic regularly. The plumber you employ to install the unit also affects the total cost for a brand-new garbage disposal. The MDH likewise recommends NOT softening the cold water supply to your kitchen faucet or your outside hose connections. This will significantly reduce the amount of sodium in your diet plan and save you money by not softening water unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, replacing a gas or electric water tank with a comparable design takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and remove your old water heater. Positioning the brand-new unit takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and confirm that all functions are up to code.</p>
