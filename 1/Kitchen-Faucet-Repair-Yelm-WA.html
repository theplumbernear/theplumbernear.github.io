An RP on a public or neighborhood pool should be tested upon installation and then yearly.</p>

In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs.

A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
