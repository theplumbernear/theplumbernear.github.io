However, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
