Water softeners typically utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
