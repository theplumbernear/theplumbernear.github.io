<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Company in Eatontown</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it usually catches deterioration after about 50 years and needs replacement.
