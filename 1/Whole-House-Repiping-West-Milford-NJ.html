Initially, prepare for each device to be set up need to be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to process and approve.

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that citizens are handling and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
