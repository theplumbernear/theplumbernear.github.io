Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
