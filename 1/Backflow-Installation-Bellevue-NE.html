Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
