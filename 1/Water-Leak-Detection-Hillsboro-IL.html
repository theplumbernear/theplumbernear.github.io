<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit comes in two standard types - continuous feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the unit. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed model is much safer but can be slower to utilize on large quantities of food waste due to the fact that you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies an overview of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
