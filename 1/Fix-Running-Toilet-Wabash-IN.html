It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown.
