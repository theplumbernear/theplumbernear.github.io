<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an effect on cleaning agent savings. The study consisted of tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to assessing filming and finding. Scientists found that softened water uses practically 30% less detergent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. That detergent savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>

Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regrowth.
