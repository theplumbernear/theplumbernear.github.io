<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are extremely important to constructing a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
