When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
