<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 basic types - continuous feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover remain in place to operate the unit. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed model is more secure but can be slower to use on big quantities of food waste because you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the issue.
