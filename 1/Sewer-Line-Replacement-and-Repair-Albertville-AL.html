<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
