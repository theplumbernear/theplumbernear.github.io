<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
