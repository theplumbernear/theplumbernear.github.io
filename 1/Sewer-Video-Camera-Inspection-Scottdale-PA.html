A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they result in small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
