<p>If you've always lived in an area with difficult water, you might not recognize how much it impacts you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation might still occur.</p>
