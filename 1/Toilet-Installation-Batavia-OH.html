<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, studs, and floorings. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
