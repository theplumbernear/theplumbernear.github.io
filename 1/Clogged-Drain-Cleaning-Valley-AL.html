Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a structure these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
