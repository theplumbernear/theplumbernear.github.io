<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
