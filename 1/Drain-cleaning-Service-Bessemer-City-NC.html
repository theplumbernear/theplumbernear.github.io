Whether these roots are obstructing your drain or triggering pipe damage, let our team help you.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced.

Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
