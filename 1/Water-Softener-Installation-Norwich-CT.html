Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining component itself. Blockages in a fixture can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
