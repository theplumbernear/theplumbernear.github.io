<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
