<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
