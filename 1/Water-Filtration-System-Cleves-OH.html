<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
