<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of professionals recommend a cautious inspection of residential water heaters on a regular basis - a minimum of every year.
