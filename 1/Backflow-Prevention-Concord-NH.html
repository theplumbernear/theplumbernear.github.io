<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Concord</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically catches deterioration after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more modern pipes won't last forever, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their lifespan.</p>
