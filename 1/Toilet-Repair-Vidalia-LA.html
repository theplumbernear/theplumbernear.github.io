If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
