<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are often perceived as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are often equivalent, though replacement normally will not need surcharges, such as application charges. New meters need to meet policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may need an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Design - Once you add a second floor and even third floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will utilize more products which adds to your labor expenses.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas home appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require an authorization and inspection.</p>
