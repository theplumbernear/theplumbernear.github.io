In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>

Typically, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>
