<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Feasterville Trevose PA 19053?</h3>
<p>If you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak, very first consider your options. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be required.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
