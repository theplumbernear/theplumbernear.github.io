The age of your house is a crucial part to understand whether or not you must repipe your house.

If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, possibilities are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>
