<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water system and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of defense for the general public water system system.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
