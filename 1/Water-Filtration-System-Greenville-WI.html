<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of interruptions in fixture branches; the repairing of incidental leakages in valves, pipes or fixtures; or the removal and reinstallation of existing or new plumbing components, residential type plumbing devices, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; provided that such repairs do not include or need the replacement of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or components.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids pollutants or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Numerous scattering systems currently have the correct backflow preventer installed and need only be tested every year. Others may not satisfy state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bath tubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working effectively that's truly all you need to understand about them, but when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the knowledge to detect a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to capture water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
