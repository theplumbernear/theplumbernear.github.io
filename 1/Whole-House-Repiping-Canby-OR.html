The unit chosen for a given installation should be appropriate for the system design and website conditions, consisting of consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to take place. Further, it needs to be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer specifications, and engineering guidelines for the type of system to be used.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
