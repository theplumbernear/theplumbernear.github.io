<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
