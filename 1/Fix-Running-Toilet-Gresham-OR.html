<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough job because of the age of your house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
