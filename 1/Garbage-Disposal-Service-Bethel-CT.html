<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You must also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling.
