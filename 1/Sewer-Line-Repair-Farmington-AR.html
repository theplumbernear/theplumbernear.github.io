<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

In your home, so much water washes through the drains, in addition to dirt, particles, hair, and other particles. Over time, this can all develop. In the beginning, you might not discover that your drains are moving slower, but after time, they will ultimately stop draining pipes entirely, which is when, you need the aid of a professional.</p>
