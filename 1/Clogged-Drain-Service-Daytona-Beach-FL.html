<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Gas lines undoubtedly need repairs-- age and usage will eventually use them down.
