<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Offering affordable, efficient, quality water softening solutions is very crucial at Kel Tren WaterCare. We offer a variety of alternatives for homes and companies that remove unwanted minerals and increase the effectiveness of water related home appliances.
