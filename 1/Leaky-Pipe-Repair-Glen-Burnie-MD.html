<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place?

Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to harden in location for several hours or 60 minutes. Once the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
