Low water pressure might be due to a plethora of aspects, however the most common factors are sediment buildup and corrosion, which both block water from travelling through the whole pipe and put unwanted pressure on specific sections of pipe.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
