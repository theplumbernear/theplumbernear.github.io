Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Watertown MA</h3>
<p>Before the repair specialist starts the repair procedure, he needs to be sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any restrictive conditions. If the area is considered a confined area, correct safety preventative measures must be followed for appropriate entry. A safe and correct workplace might involve the positioning of security barriers or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair technician or the general public around your workspace are not harmed. This might affect the specialist's capability to effectively finish the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a limiting area.</p>
<p>We're understood for our on-time arrivals, especially our 60-90 minute reaction times 24 hours a day as well as for our quick and polite plumbers that respect you and your home.
