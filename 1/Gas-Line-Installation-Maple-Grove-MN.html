Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage.

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home.

<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical form it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop must be greater than 33 feet to work properly. When designed in this manner it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system.
