<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
