<p>You have to spend a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to utilize but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
