The brine tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
