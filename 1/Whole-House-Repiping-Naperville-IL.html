<p>Due to the fact that it is more cost-effective to power them with gas than with electricity, these types of hot water heaters are typically powered by natural gas. Gas water heaters cost more than electrical water heaters to install at first, however end up costing about half as much to run - conserving you substantial amounts of cash on your utility bill in the long run.</p>
