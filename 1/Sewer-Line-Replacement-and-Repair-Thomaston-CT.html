<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
