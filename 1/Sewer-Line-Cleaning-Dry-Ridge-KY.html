<p>Recommendations: A knowledgeable plumbing company ought to have the ability to give you the names of recent clients in your part of town. It can take a DIYer a lot of time to find and complete basic repairs, so think about that with the cost when trying to handle the problem by yourself. The reason a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can likewise be the cause.
