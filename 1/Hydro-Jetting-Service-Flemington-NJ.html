<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
