I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.

The water in your sink, shower, or toilet drains slowly - This is the most common sign that you've got a drain stoppage. While sluggish draining pipes indicates the drain isn't completely clogged, there's still enough buildup inside it to stop water and waste from going down easy.</p>
<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
