As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another tip to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
