Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
