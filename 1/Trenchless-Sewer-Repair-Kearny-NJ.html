<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
