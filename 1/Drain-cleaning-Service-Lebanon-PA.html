<p>Digital Displays: These help you tailor the water and keep track of heater operation much faster and more easily. They show tank levels, temperature, pressure, and other information. They also have automobile settings such as vacation modes that increases energy performance. These "hardness ions" trigger two significant kinds of problems.
