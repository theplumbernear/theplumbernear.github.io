The backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated once again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow diagram is essential to ensure it was repaired properly. A properly fixed assembly needs to provide years of protection.</p>
