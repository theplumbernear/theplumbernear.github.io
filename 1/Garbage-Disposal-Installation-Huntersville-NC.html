<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
