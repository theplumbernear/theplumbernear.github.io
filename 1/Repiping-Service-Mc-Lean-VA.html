<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Mc Lean Virginia</h2>
<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
