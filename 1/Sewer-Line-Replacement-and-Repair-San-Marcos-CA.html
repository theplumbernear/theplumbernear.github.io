<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires precisely, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Everyone who's installed a few disposals is aware of this error: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the system.
