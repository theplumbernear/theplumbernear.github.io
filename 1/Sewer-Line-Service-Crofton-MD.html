<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop.

Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
