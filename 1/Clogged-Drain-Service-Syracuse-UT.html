During regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage.
