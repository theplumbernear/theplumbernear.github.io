<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
