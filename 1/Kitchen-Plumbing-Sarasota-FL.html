<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is a development that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism frequently acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally get rid of short-term solidity in water.</p>
