<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
<h3>Kitchen Faucet Leaking in Sault Sainte Marie Michigan</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

In potable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic locations with corrosive water contaminants.</p>
