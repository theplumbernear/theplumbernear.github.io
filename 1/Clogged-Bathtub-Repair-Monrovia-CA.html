<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
