In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the task with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
