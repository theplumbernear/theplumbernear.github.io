<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Mineral Wells TX 76067</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
