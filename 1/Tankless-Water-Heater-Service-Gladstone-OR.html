Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Checking the condition, water, and age lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend numerous things, including water pressure and indications of leaks.
