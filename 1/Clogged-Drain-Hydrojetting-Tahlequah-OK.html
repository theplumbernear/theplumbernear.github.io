<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You must also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
