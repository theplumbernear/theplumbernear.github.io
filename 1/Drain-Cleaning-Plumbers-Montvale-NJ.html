<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
