<p>Tankless Water Heaters - provide hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water triggers the heater and water is warmed as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the waste disposal unit due to the fact that they can hinder the blades. Lastly, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to ensure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
