<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To maintain your house, health, and security comfort, we use only the best piping: polyethylene.

<p>Positive-Action Brine Valve - Snap-together building eliminates use of solvents that may infect water. Favorable action helps prevent overfilling. In your house, so much water washes through the drains, in addition to dirt, debris, hair, and other particles. Gradually, this can all build up.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable option to do simply that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
