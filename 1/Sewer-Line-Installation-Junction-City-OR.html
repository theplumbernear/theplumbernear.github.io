It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
