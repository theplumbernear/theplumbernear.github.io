All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly must satisfy the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be stopped up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
