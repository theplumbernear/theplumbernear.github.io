For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.
