<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
