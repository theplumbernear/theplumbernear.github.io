<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
