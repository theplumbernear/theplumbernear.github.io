It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
