<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics.
