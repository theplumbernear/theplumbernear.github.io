Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
