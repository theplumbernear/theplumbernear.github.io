<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
