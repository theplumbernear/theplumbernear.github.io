If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
