<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
