<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
