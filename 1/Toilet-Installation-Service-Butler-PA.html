<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
