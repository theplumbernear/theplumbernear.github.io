<p>You most likely know something about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, sinks, and showers to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's really all you need to know about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
