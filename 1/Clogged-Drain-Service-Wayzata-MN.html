<h3>Shower Valve Replacement in Wayzata Minnesota</h2>
<p>Depending upon your situation, your plumber may use one or a combination of piping material during your home repiping job. Copper is standard because it's lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is difficult to install, which implies higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which indicates plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves money and time and reduces the threat of joint leaks. PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending on your requirements.</p>
