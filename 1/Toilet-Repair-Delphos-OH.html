<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
