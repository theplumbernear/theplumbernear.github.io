<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Based on the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable alternative to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
