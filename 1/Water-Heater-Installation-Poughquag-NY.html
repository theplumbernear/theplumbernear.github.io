<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to resolve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Drain cleanouts provide an entry point into your house's drainage system so blockages can be removed. They are generally white pipes located outside your house but can be other colors.
