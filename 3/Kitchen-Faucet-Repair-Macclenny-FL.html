The unit selected for a given installation needs to be proper for the system style and website conditions, including consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to take place. Further, it needs to be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, producer specs, and engineering standards for the type of unit to be used.</p>
<p>This may sound like a joke, but it's extremely severe if you want to truly get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
