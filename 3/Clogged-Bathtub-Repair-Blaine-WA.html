<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a stable and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait till after the cycle is finished and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
