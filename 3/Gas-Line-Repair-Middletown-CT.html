<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Middletown CT 06457</h3>

Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Numerous sprinkling systems currently have the proper backflow preventer set up and need just be tested every year. Others may not meet state and local guidelines and may need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
