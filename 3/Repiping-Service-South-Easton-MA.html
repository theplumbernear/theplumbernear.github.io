Whatever you call it, changing one out or setting up a brand-new one is a relatively easy task. The deal with private mains usually takes one to two weeks, and service work usually takes an additional one to 2 weeks, though some may be carried out concurrently on a task. However, the gas to your home will only have to be switched off for a short time period (typically less than four hours).</p>
<p>A water heater leak can be a sign of a wide variety of problems, all of which need to be fixed right away to prevent total appliance failure.

Roto-Rooter plumbers are specialists at water heater leak repair.</p>
