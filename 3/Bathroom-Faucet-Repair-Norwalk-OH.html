Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

Residences built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health threats associated with lead.</p>
<p>For instance, if your water heater is constantly breaking down and requiring repair, a new unit will save you money. Furthermore, if you notice rising energy costs from an inefficient unit, you will also conserve money with a new installation. We suggest that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to save the property owner money and time in the future.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can develop major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
