Always continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
