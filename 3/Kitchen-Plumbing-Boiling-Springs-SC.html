He noted that there are specific pollutants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those concerns. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste.

Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
