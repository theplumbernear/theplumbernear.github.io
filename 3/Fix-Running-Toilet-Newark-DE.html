<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very happy with their service.</p>
