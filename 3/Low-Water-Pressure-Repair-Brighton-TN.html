<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city resident of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her house. It didn't just enhance and make cleaning much easier, but it helps minimize waste as well.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
