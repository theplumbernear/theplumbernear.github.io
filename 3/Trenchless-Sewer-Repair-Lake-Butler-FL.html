Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>

A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- particularly common in older homes. Utilizing a sewer camera to inspect the weak areas or clog, our highly trained professionals can quickly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- efficiently carrying wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or local system.</p>
<p>Some softeners work on electricity, however some more recent water softeners use waterpower.
