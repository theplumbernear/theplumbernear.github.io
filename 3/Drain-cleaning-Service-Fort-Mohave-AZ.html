<p>Often brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate intermittently, also. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
