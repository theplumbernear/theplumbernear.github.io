<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or permanent connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by replacing that section of harmed piping. However, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your house, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Few house owners are delighted with the idea of changing all their pipes, however dealing with the job prior to the plumbing system fails allows you to prevent significant property damage.</p>
