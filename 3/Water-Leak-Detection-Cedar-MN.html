<h3>Shower Drain in Cedar Minnesota</h2>
<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
