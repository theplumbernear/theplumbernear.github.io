At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can develop a suction impact and draw potential pollutants into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank hot water heater are typically found in many homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required.
