Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
