<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
