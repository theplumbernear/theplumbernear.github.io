<h3>Sewer Drain in Paramount California</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public supply of water and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
