<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician shut off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The consumer assisted our service technician in moving the toilet back into its proper location, and the service technician tightened the bolts prior to bring back the water system and ensuring that the toilet was correctly flushing.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
