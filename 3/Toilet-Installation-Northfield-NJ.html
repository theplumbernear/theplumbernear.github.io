<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
