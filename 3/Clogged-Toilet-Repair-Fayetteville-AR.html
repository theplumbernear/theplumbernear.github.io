(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
