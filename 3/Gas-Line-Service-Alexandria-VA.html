<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
