The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
