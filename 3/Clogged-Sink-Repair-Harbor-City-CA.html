<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Harbor City CA 90710</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with hard water, you might not realize just how much it affects you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
