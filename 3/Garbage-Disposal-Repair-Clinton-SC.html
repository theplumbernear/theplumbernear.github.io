<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
