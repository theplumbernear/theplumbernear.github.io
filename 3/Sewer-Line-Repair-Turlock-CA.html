Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not present a danger to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
