<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Cottage Grove MN 55016</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
