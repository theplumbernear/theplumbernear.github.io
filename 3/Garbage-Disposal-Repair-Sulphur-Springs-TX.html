These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most typical indications that your system is at completion of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
