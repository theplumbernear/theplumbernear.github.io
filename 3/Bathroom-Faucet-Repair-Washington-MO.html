The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
