<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Russellville AR</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
