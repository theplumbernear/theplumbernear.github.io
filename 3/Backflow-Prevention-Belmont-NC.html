<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Belmont NC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a threat to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
