<p>One typical method for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls.
