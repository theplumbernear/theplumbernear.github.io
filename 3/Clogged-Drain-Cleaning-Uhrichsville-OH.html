<h3>Drain Plumbing in Uhrichsville Ohio</h2>
<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help eliminate them if you have rust spots. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest approach possibly try using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety warnings initially!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to eliminate rust spots and it's readily available at many hardware shops.</p>
