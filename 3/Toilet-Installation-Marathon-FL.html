<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you must only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture wetness so that it doesn't go into the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
