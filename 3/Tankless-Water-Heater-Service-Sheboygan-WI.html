<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the issue. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products utilized by plumbing specialists. PEX and copper both use numerous benefits and benefits such as removing the metallic taste from your water.</p>
