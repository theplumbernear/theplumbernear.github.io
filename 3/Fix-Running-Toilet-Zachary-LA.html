<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>

<p>No, you need to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
