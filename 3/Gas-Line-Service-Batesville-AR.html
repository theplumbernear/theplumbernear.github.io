<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
