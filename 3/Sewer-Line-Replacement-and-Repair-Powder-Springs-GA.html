Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
