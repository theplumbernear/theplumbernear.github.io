<p>The water used to restore the softener beads winds up as waste.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>A trained plumber would not advise a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may suggest moving toilets to different restrooms to lessen any future interruptions.
