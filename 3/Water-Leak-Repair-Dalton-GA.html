<p>Is your home 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main product utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically succumbs to corrosion after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more modern-day pipes won't last forever, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that could be reaching completion of their lifespan.</p>

<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently noted need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>

<p>There are two main types of backflow systems: air space (AG) and reduced pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's approximated that each person utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a lot of water. In fact, it's an amount that can send a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're counting on a broken or outdated hot water heater.</p>

<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent alternative for most people, there are some situations where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of replacing old corroded pipes with long lasting and long-lasting brand-new pipes. Because of their durability and other elements, the brand-new pipes that are used are typically made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
