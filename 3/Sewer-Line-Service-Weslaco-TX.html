<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can cause a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using among these products.</p>
