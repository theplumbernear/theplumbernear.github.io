<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly.
