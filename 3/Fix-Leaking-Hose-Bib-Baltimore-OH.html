<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>In time, like any other device in your home, your garbage disposal. might require repairs. A disposal system might begin or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage.
