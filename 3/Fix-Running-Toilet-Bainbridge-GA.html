<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
