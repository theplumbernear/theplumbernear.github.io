<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
