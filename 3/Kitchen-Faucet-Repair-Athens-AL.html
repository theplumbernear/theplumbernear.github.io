<p>Utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. A number of homes in my area being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this.
