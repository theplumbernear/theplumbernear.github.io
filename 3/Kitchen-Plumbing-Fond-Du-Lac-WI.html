<h3>Drain Cleaning in Fond Du Lac WI 54935 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
