When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
