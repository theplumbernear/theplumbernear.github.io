<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Tuscaloosa AL</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. There are two basic piping materials utilized by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both provide various benefits and advantages such as eliminating the metal taste from your water.</p>
