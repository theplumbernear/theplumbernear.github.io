<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>These are terrific water heaters and they are perfect for homes. Specifically for homes that have limited space or use large quantities of warm water. Since they instantly heat water, there is no need to shop currently heated water and they use an endless quantity of hot water, which implies you will never ever lack warm water.
