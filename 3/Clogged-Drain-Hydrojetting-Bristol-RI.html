<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items including severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - provide warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases need to never ever be put down the waste disposal unit since they can impede the blades. Lastly, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>
