<h3>Water Softener Repair Installation in Rochester Michigan</h2>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
