<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Virginia MN</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Was your home built before the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has actually corroded and decayed over the years if so. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
