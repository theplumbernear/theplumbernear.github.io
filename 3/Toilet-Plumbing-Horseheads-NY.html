<p>If you've always resided in an area with tough water, you may not recognize how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
