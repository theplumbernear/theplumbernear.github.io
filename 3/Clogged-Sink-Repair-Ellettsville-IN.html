Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
