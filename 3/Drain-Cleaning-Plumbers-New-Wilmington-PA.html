<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their unclean or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
