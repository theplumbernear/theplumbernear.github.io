<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
