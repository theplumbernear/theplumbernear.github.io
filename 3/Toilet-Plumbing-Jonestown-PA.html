<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used.
