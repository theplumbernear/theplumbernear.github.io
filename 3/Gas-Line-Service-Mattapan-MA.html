It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
