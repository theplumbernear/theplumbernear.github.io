<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon.

You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
