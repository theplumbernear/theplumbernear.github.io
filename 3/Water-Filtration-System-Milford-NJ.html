<p>The most efficient method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Depending on the degree of the clog, we may use a range of different techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains.
