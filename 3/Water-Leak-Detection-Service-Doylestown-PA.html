It is really difficult to evaluate such claims, which are almost never ever based upon tests that are well adequate explained to enable others to evaluate them and to validate the outcomes. While the lack of "scientific" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it should make one be reluctant to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house.
