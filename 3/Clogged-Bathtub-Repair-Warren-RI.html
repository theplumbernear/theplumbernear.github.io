It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>Toilets are challenging things to understand. They have actually been built practically the exact same method for hundreds of years, so you can't really inform how old they are. It might not work extremely well all the time, however you can't inform if that's normal or not. Plus, there's that omnipresent but never ever unacknowledged sensation that it's you-you're in some way doing something wrong therein.</p>
