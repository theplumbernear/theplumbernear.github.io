<h3>Gas Line Installation in Naperville Illinois</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
