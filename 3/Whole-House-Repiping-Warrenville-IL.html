<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
