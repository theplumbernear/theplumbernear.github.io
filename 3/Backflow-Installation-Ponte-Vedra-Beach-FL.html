This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>

This might mean that the water doesn't have a clear course to do through, more than likely because of a blocked drain. This is also the very best time to add the cable and plug to your disposal.
