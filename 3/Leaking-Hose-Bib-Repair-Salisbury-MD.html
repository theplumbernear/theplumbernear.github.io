<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Salisbury MD 21804</h3>
<p>If you've always resided in an area with tough water, you may not recognize how much it affects you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more.

If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>

As a clog becomes larger gradually, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately. You can combat hard water in different ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
