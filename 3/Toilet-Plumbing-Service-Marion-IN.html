<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "difficult" depends on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in truth, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that give water the revitalizing taste many individuals discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this moment the water is said to be difficult.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
