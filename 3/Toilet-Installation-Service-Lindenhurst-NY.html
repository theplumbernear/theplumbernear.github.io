<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Lindenhurst NY 11757</h3>
<p>First consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has begun to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be needed. Often, relining your existing pipes is a much better choice. If your sewer lines are below trees, near extensive landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
