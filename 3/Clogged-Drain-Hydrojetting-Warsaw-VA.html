<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first acquire the required license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our License page to learn more on obtaining an authorization. Once you obtain a permit you can start with the work. However, you need to call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to five days, depending on the size of the home, how many levels it has and the picked pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, totally replace the pipes, reinstall the eliminated drywall and patch it to eliminate any indications of damage or change to your home.</p>

The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
