<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Woodburn OR</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is considered to not position a danger to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
