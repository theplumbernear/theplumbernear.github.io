<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Saint Augustine FL</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
