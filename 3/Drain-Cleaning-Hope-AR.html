<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

Internal sources consist of the aforementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning jobs, and appliances such as meal washers, hot water tanks, glowing water heating systems, and so on.
