<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these products.</p>
