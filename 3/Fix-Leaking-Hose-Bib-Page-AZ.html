<h3>Drain Cleaning in Page AZ 86040 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indication of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is very important that you call a qualified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is really hazardous and can present serious health risks.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with known backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
