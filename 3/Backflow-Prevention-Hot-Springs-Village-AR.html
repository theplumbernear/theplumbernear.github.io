<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Hot Springs Village AR</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now.

I chose this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
