Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water supply within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
