<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Everyday usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  area.
