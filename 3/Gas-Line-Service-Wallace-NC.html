<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
