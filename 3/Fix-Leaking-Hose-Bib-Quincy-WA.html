<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.
