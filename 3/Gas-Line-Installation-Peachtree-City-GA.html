<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
