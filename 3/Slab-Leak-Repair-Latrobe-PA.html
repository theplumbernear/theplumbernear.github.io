<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and obligation are extremely essential to developing a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water supply within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
