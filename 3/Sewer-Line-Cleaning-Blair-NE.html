<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
