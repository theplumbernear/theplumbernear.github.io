<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
