Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely formed bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not distribute your weight equally and could ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
