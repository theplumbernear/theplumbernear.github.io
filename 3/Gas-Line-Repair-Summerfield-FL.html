<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than useful, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe is worth the financial investment in the long run because it may deal with the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>There can be a variety of reasons you home or organisation is experiencing sewer problems. If your toilets are flushing gradually, you're experiencing consistent sewer backups, or see a nasty or odd smell is originating from your drains, it might be an indication that it is time to call professionals to completely examine your drains and solve your sewer problems.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair requirements can be resolved fairly quickly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain might need to be taken apart, analyzed, and cleared before being changed. Sometimes, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is necessary (like a reducer, tailpiece, or pvc  trap) to make sure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair alternatives.</p>
