<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
