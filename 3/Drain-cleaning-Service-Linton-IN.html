<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Linton IN</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly maintained. Making sure the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and assistance relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
