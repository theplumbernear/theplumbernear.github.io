<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber if you want it to work well for years to come. It is a reasonably easy device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that turns at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are little enough, they go through to the rest of the wastewater to be gotten rid of. If you have a battle drain setup, it usually takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on just one side.</p>

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
