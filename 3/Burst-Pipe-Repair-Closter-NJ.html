<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
