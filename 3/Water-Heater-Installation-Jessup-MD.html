<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
