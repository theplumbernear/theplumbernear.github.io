<p>Depending upon your circumstance, your plumber might utilize one or a mix of piping material throughout your house repiping project. Copper is standard because it's lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is hard to install, which means higher labor expenses.

PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>
