<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Norman OK 73072</h3>

<p>Never fret about hidden costs or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We offer affordable flat-rate rates on all our services. The house still had lead pipes. Houses integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health threats connected with lead.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
