<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
