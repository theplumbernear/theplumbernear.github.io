<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
