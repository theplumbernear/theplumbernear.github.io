<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
