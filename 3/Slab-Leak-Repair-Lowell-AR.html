Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
