<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, especially if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Never ever fret about concealed charges or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We provide affordable flat-rate prices on all our services. The home still had lead pipes. Houses built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes.

<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating provides a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- specifically common in older houses.
