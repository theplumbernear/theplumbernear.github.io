<p>If you discover yourself continuously wiggling the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to contact one of our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in discovering the leak or broken element and repairing it. Grease: Never ever put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these materials often congeal to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these kinds of sinks. Should you come across a specialized faucet repair that requires special order parts, we can position the order and get the sink repaired as soon as the part arrives. Ion exchange resins, in the kind of beads, are a practical component of domestic water softening units. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area, strap the water heater to the wall with special straps (Fig. A; offered at plumbing stores and house centers). Your plumbing inspector will inform you if they're needed.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or tarnished water, it typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
