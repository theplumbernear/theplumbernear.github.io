Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
