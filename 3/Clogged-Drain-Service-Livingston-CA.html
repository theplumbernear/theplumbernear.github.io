Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
