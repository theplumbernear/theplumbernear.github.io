<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
