<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
