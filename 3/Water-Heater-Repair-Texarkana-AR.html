<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Texarkana AR 71854</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
