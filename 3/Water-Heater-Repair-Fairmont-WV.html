<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
