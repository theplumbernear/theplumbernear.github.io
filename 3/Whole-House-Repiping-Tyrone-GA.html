<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of choices if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a blockage. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
