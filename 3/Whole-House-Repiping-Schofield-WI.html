<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
