It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
