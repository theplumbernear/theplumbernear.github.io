Sediment Build-Up: If you see weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water rapidly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>If you are considering installing a brand-new water heater, think about going tankless. Garbage disposals should use a grounded outlet for power. If you do not have one already installed nearby, one can be included for around $120.
