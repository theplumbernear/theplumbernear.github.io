Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
