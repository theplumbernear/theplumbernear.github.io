<p>Backpressure might occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
