<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To keep your security, home, and health convenience, we use only the best piping: polyethylene. Many homes and businesses use galvanized pipes for water circulation, which tend to degrade and can adversely affect our health. Copper is likewise commonly used since of its durability and much safer building and construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the market and makes sure the healthiest and cleanest water circulation.</p>
