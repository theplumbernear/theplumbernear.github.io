<p>Colored water-- If your warm water seems rusty, this could be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking soon.

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm.
