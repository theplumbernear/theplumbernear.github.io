<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low.

For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
