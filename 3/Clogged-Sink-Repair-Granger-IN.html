Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
