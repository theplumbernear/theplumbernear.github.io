<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog.

Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside.
