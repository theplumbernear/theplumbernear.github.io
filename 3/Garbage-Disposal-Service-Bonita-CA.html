<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a long lasting surface and a reliable stopper mechanism.

The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
