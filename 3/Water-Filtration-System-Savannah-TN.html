<h3>Toilet Plumbing in Savannah Tennessee</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).
