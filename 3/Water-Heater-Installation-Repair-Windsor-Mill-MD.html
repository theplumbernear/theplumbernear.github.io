Your kitchen may end up being clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that cause the obstruction. Your toilet may become stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you might have a house-wide backup brought on by sewage coming back up through the pipes.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
