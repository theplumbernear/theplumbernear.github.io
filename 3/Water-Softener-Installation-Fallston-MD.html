You, therefore, need to use a growing number of cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
