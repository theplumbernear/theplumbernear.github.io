<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>

The tank eventually loses its ability to seal appropriately, developing waste and a greater water bill.</p>
