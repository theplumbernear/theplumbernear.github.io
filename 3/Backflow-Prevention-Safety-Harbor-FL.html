<p>You are accountable for replacing the assembly or fixing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly must meet the lead totally free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be terminated until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner.

The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
