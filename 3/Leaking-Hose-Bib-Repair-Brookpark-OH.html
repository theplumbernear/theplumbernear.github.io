<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out yearly forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners want to get their hands dirty with. It needs more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is typically due to how bothersome it is to examine the damage. This is even more bothersome if the damage is irreversible or requires more comprehensive repair work, especially in commercial settings.</p>
