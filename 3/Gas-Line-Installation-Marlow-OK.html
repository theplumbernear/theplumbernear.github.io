<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to examine. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Though it's not always necessary, in some cases the plumber might need to update or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be tarnished or degraded if the gas line is damaged. Contact our professionals to identify the extent of the problem.</p>
