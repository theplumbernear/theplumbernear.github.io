<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Putnam Valley</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
