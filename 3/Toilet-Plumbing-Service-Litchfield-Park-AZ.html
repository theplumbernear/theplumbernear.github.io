Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
