<p>When your water heater starts to lose its effectiveness, we are prepared to step in and help.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
