The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>

The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
