<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing homeowner wish to get their hands filthy with. It requires more than simply effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is often due to how troublesome it is to assess the damage. This is much more problematic if the damage is irreparable or needs more extensive repair, especially in commercial settings.</p>
