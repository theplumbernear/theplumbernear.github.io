<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
