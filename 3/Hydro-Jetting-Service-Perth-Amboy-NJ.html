<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
