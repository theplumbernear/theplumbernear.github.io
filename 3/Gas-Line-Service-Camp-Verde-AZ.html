<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. When shopping for a new flapper, your best alternative is to attempt and discover the same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve. The easiest way to do that is by searching for your toilet design and selecting the flapper advised for that design. If you do not understand your model number, however, we do use an extensive selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. See the video below to read more about the various type of flappers offered, or check out How To Replace Toilet Flappers for quick tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the material. To keep your security, health, and home convenience, we use just the very best piping: polyethylene. Numerous homes and services use galvanized pipes for water circulation, which tend to degrade and can adversely affect our health. Copper is also frequently used because of its longevity and much safer building and construction, but polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and guarantees the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>
