Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.
