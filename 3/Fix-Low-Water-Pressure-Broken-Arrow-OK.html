At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
