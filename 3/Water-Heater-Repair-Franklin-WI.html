<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
