<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Add more warm water if it gradually recedes as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to try a new approach.
