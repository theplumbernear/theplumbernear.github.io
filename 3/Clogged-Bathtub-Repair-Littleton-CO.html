<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
