<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Gretna LA 70056</h3>
<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
