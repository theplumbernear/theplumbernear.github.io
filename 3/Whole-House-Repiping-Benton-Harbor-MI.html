<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Each and every single person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to help me through this very stressful task. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service business ought to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're terrific.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
