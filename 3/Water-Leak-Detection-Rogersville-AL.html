<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be a sign of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a consistent sewage odor in your home, it is crucial that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is very unsafe and can posture severe health threats.</p>
