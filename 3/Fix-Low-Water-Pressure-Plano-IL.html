<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.
