<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a potential issue with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life.
