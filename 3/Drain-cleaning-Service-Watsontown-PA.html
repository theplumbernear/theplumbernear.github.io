<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
