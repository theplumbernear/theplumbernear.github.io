<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
