<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in two basic types - constant feed, which normally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to operate the system. Continuous feed prevails and the simplest to utilize; a batch feed design is much safer but can be slower to use on large quantities of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
