<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains.

Difficult water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
