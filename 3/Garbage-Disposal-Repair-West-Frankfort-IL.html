<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
