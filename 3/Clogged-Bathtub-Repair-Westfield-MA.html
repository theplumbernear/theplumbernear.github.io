<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that come from inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Jams-- The disposal may end up being jammed with food or other items. We can clear jams and help customers understand what they need to not put down their disposals.
