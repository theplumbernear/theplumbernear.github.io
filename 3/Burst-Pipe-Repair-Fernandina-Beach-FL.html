<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls.
