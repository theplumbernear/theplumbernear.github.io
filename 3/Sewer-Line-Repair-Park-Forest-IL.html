<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself.
