<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
