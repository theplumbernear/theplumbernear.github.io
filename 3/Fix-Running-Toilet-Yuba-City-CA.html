<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
