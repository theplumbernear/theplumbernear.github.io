Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
