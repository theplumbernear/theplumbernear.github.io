<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Another difference between soft and difficult water is dullness of your hair and clothes. If you have hard water, your hair may feel dull and do not have body, and your clothes will start to fade and might break earlier.
