<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and might often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other two types of salts. When the new salt has had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>

<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and circumstances that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is necessary for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well.

The correction should be made before water service is allowed if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
