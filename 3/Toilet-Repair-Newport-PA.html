Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
