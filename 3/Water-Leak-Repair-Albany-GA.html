<p>If you discover yourself continuously jerking the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to employ among our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in discovering the leak or broken part and fixing it. Grease: Never ever pour grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of washing away, these products typically cake to form nasty obstructions, which you might need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
