<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak.
