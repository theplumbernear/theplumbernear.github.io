<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber San Juan TX</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally sodium. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
