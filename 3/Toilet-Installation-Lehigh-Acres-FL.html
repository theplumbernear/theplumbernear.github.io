<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Changing galvanized pipes in older homes is important because of the way galvanized pipes tend to degrade over the years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc.
