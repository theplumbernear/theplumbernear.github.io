<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both.

With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
