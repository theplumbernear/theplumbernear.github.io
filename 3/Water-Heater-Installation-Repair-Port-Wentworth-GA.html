<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Port Wentworth GA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
