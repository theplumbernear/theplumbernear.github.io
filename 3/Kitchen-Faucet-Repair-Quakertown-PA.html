<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
