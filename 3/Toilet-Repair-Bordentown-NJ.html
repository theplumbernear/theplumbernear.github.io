<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely eliminates firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
