If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
