<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
