<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
