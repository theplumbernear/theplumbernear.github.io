Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as wanted.</p>

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
