<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the system).

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
