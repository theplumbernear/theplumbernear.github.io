<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
