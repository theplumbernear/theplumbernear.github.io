However you risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Tough water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to fret about any issues with mineral deposits staying.
