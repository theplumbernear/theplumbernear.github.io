<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>The installation of plumbing systems are overseen by qualified public authorities that specify the requirements for its style, management and composition, and the training and practices of the plumbers and operators who develop and keep the systems. Having the drain back up or the nasty odor of a malfunctioning sewer drain in your home is more than an inconvenience, it makes everything else stop. When this occurs you need a plumbing company that can get there quick. Identify the full magnitude of the issue, and fix it quick.</p>
