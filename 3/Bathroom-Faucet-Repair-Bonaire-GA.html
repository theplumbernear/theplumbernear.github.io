<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the task potentially dangerous.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
