<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the technician to accurately take a look at conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and suggest the best solution also. We can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
