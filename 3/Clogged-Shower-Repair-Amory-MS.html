<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Amory MS 38821</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
