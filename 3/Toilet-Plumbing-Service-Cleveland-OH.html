They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
