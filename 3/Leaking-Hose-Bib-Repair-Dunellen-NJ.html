<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
