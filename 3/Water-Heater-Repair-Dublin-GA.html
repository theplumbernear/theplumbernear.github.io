<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
