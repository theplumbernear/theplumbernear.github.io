<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a severe issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken.

<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is normally identified before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to constantly leak out very gradually. With time it can result in a significant build of water.

This is an uncommon event and in general, there is little concern over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>
<p>Typically caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl.

Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
