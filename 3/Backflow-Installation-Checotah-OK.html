<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
