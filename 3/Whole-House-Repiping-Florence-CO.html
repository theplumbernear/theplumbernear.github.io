<h3>Pot filler Repair in Florence Colorado</h2>
<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing clogs. They typically utilize sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While efficient at removing obstructions, they might do your plumbing more harm than good. Here are 3 reasons to prevent putting these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable model takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater. Placing the brand-new system takes approximately 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and validate that all functions depend on code.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
