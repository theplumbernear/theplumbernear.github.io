<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
