<p>Our commercial plumbers are concentrated on adding to the health, security and convenience of customers and their consumers throughout the Illinois and Wisconsin area.

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Buying a house is a big investment. Understanding if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when working out the sale of a house. There are a lot of kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's an excellent idea to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable safety measures if using one of these items.</p>
