<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Mogadore OH</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.

<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
