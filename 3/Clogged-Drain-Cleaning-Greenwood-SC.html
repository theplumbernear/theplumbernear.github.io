<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water system since it can spread polluted water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or real connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable pollutants or contaminants to enter the drinkable water system.
