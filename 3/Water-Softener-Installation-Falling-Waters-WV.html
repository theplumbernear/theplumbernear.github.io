<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately secured, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
