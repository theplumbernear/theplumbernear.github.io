<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
