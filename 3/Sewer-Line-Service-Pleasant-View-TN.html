<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
