<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

Many homeowners eventually see hair or soap scum building up in their sinks. When not right away corrected, the stopper or drain might become obstructed.
