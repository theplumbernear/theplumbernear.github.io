Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.
