<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing.
