<p>Having your plumbing frequently evaluated is a key component of preventative maintenance. However, many house owners and entrepreneur have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not evaluate their pipes till there is a pressing issue. Regrettably, this method enables leaks, tears, and other problems to go unnoticed, allowing them to become worse and even worse as time goes on.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
