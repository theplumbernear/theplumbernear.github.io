<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
