<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing issues plumbers face, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
