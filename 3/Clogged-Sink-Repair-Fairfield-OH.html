Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can cause harmful damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
