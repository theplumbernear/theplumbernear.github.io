<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your house.</p>

Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, firmness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip.
