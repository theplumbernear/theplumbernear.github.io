The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?

<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly.

We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
