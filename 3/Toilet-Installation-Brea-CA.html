<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
