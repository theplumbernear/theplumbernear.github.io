<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
