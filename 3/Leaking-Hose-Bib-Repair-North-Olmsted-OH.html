<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the service is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive option is required: repiping.</p>

If the hot water heater has been preserved with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic service warranty.
