<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are commonly discovered with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably costly, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements usually discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also exceptionally durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly utilized pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>

Hard water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits staying. This makes chores much easier and less annoying for everyone involved.</p>
