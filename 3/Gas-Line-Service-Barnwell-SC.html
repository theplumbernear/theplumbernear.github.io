<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>You probably understand something about your drains: they take water from your sinks, showers, and bath tubs to a local water treatment center. When drains are working appropriately that's truly all you need to know about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the know-how to identify a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
