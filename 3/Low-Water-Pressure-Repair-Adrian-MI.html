<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
