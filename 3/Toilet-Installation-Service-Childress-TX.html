Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a very short amount of time due to closing on a home sale.

Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and really cared to help me through this extremely difficult task. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service company should be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're terrific.</p>
