<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Reduced to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation usually through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regeneration.</p>
