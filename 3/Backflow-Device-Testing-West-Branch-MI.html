Inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins freely.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
