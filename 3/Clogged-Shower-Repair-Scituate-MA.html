<p>If your assembly fails the annual test, you are responsible for changing the assembly or fixing within 30 days. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly must fulfill the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be stopped until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this might be a sign that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and might start leaking quickly. You can check on this by filling a couple of five-gallon buckets with your water.
