<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
