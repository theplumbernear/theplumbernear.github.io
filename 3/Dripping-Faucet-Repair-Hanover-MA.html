<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
