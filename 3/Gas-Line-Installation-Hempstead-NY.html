<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
