<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we recommend that homeowners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.
