<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
