The city or Uruk includes the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily removable and changeable sections, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up.
