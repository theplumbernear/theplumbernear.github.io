<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
