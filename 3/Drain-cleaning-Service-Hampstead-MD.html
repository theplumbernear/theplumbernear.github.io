That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines need to be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will get unique attention, an experienced plumber looks to take a look at the complete health of your system. That suggests testing for appropriate water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with inefficient water home appliances.</p>
